"Webilastik" is a rewrite of classic ilastik's architecture to make it more portable and to drop legacy code.

For motivation on the design decisions, have a look at the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/110_1IOqel1QU1aKrznDaZIT5Rr1HbTbUVOfxwVnFFO0/edit?usp=sharing)


Webilastik heavily uses [ndstructs](https://github.com/ilastik/ndstructs) to have sane 5D arrays, points and slices.

# Server

In order to use ilastik over the web, a user must first allocate a session (which for now can run either locally as a separate process or remotely on CSCS). This session allocation is done by `webilastik/server/session_allocator.py`. This executable is an HTTP handler that will itself spawn other HTTP servers, which are the user sessions, and those sessions will actually run computations for the user.

An HTTP server to expose webilastik should be configured with options analogous to those in `package_tree/etc/nginx/sites-available/webilastik.conf`. The important thing to note is the redirection from requests of the form `session-<session-id>` to `http://unix:/tmp/to-session-$session_id`, since those unix sockets will tunnel back to the user sessions, which might be running in different machines than that which is hosting `webilastik/server/session_allocator.py`. Also, CORS must be enabled since ilastik will probably not be running on the same server as the viewer.

# Client (Overlay)

This project contains an npm project in `./overlay`, which can be used to build the ilastik client. It is an overlay that can be applied on top of neuroglancer or vanilla HTML `<img/>` tags (for now, via bookmarklet injection), and contains all controls required to request a session, add brush strokes, select image features and visualize predictions.

# Building
 - Install build dependencies:
    - [conda-pack](https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/) (for wrapping the cnoda environment)
    - [go-task](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation) (make-like application to build the targets in Taskfile.yml)
    - npm (for building neuroglancer and the overlay)
 - Build the `.deb` package: `task create-deb-package`

# Running
 Right now webilastik _needs_ to run via HTTPS because, as it is meant to be used as an overlay, it must be able to set cookies in cross origin sites, and that is only posible (or at least, way easier) via HTTPS.

## Production
- Install nginx
- Configure SSL if that's the first time setup (e.g.: `sudo certbot --nginx -d app.ilastik.org`)
- Install the newly created `.deb` package: `sudo apt install ./webilastik*.deb`
- And start the service if it doens't automatically: `systemctl start webilastik.service`

## Local dev server
Even the local server needs Nginx to be running. This is because webilastik allocates worker sessions for the users, and those sessions can be running in remote worker servers. These worker sessions create SSH tunnels on the main server, and nginx will redirect session requests into those tunnels sockets.

- Install nginx
- Add `webilastik.conf` to nginx configuration:
    ```
    cp package_tree/etc/nginx/sites-available/webilastik.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/webilastik.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/webilastik.conf
    ```
- Configure SSL:
    - Add `127.0.0.1 app.ilastik.org` to your `/etc/hosts` file
    - Install a ca cert and create a cert and key, probably via [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert):
        - `mkcert -install`
        - `mkcert app.ilastik.org # use the output files from this command in the next step`
    - You can uncomment the following lines in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/webilastik.conf` and make them point to your cert and key generated by `mkcert`:
        ```
        #listen 443 ssl;
        #ssl_certificate /etc/webilastik/cert.pem;
        #ssl_certificate_key /etc/webilastik/cert-key.pem;
        ```
- Restart nginx after SSL is configured: `sudo systemctl restart nginx.service`

- Run the "dev" server locally: `task start-local-server`. This task will do some basic checking to see if you have completed the previous steps before attempting to run the server. Now every time you edit something anywhere in the project you can just restart the server by re-running the `start-local-server` task.

# Concepts

## DataSource

A class that inherits from the base `DataSource` provides tiled image data to be processed. An instance of `DataSource` is aware of the image's size, shape, data type and tile shape.

## DataRoi

A `DataRoi` is a class that encapsulates both a a `DataSource` and an `Interval`, and represents an area of interest on a particular image. Because a `DataRoi` also carries a reference to the `DataSource` itself, it can be moved and/or expanded over the contents of the image, which is useful when dealing with operations than need a halo around a particular region of interest.

## Operators

A refinement of the Operator concept in classic ilastik; they represent a lazy computation that usually can be applied to a `webilastik.datasource.DataRoi`.

Operators implement the `Operator[IN, OUT]` protocol and for now must only implement `def __call__(self, /, input: IN) -> OUT` . The most common implementation being `.__call__(self, /, roi: DataRoi) -> Array5D` when dealing with operators that use halos. This means that once you have an operator instantiated, you can apply it over any slice of any `DataSource` and the operator will be able to retrieve any extra data if needs from the `DataRoi` object.

Operators do *not* deal with "Slots" or "dirty propagation" like in classic ilastik; This functionality is UI-only in webilastik. Operators are always ready to compute and do not need any other steps to be taken beyond successfully constructing one.

Wherever it makes sense, operators will take a `preprocessor: Optional[Operator]` constructor argument, which allows them to be composed with each other, e.g.:

```python
thresholder_op = Thresholder(threshold=30)
connected_components_op = ConnectedComponentsExtractor(
    preprocessor=thresholder_op, ...
)
# the connected components operator will first threshold the data with thresholder_op,
# and then look for the components on the thresholded data
# on the thresholded data
connected_components: Array4D = connected_components_op(roi=some_region_of_the_image)
```

## Applets

`Applets` are a UI-only concept; they usually will represent the user's intent on creating an `Operator`, but they can also just represent the "model" behind some GUI widget like a form.

Applets are organized in a Directed Acyclic Graph, where the vertices are the Applets and the edges are `AppletOutputs` (see section below).

The base `Applet` class contains some `__init__` logic which registers dependencies between applets; It does so by scanning all the applet attributes and keeping track of the ones that are instances of `AppletOutput` (see next session) and that belong to a different applet than `self`. This **must run after all attributes of 'self' have been set** in the child class constructor. The easiest way to achieve that is to make sure custom applets call `super().__init__()` as the **last step** of their construction. This restriction allows for easy inheritance between custom `Applets`, with child classes creating more `AppletOutputs`.

Applets are constructed already connected to all of its upstream applets and cannot disconnect from them throughout their lifetimes. In practice, this means that the `Applet` constructor should take as parameters all the `AppletOutputs` from upstream applets that it might need to perform its task.

### AppletOutputs  - applet "live properties"

Applets declare their observable properties by annotating a method with `@applet_output`. This transforms that method into an object of type `AppletOutput`, which can then be fed downstream to the other applets.

Whenever an applet constructor (say, B) takes an `AppletOutput` from another applet (say, A), then B is said to be downstream from A, i.e., changes in applet A will trigger a call to `B.refresh()`, giving B an opportunity to update its values to reflect the changes that happened upstream at A.

### Cascading changes

Whenever an applet defines a method that changes its state, that method should be annotated with the `@cascade` decorator. This decorator will cause downstream applets to be notified that something changed upstream by calling their `refresh` method (which is equivalent in spirit to the `setupOutputs` method in classic ilastik's Operators).

A method decorated with `@cascade` must take a `user_prompt: UserPrompt` parameter. This is a function that can be called by downstream applets to get user confirmation whenever they are about to do something that the user might regret (like destroying data or cause long-running computation to be triggered). If the user does not confirm the action in a way that a downstream applet expects, the entire cascade transaction is aborted and all applets are reverted to their previous state.

## Workflows

Workflows are a predefined collection of `Applets`. Ideally, workflows implement no logic; As much as possible, the `Applets` should be independant of external logic, so that they can be reused in multiple workflows. Interaction with a workflow should also be through the applets, so in a `PixelClassificationWorkflow`, for example, adding brush strokes is done via the `PixelClassificationWorkflow.brushing_applet : BrushingApplet` attribute, and not through some custom workflow method that would have to be re-implemented for every workflow.
